Description:
	This project focuses on automating the prediction of diabetes using historical data and machine learning models, with an emphasis on reducing false positives to enhance early detection and intervention. The initiative leveraged data science methodologies to develop and evaluate models that could support healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals effectively.

Key Highlights:
	Objective:
	•	Minimized false positives to reduce unnecessary stress and medical interventions for healthy individuals.
	•	Prioritized early and accurate identification of diabetes cases to enable timely treatment.
	
 Data Preparation:
	•	Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify key predictors such as high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and general health.
	•	Prepared data for modeling, ensuring balanced class representation and robust feature selection.

 Model Development:
	•	Developed and evaluated two machine learning models: Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
	•	Tuned models to optimize performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

 Key performance metrics for Logistic Regression:
	•	Accuracy: 85%
	•	Precision: 86%
	•	Recall: 98%

•	KNN achieved slightly lower performance but provided additional feature insights, with key predictors aligning with real-world medical procedures.

Insights:
	•	Logistic Regression emerged as the most effective model, balancing precision and recall to reduce false positives while ensuring high detection rates.
	•	High blood pressure and general health status were identified as the most influential predictors.

Impact:
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in healthcare, providing a foundation for integrating predictive models into clinical workflows. By reducing false positives and improving early detection, the approach supports better resource allocation and improved patient outcomes.
